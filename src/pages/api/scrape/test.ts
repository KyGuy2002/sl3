Create automatially protected worlds under your control for just yourself, you and friends, or the community.\n#### We welcome everyone! Our server is natively Java (PC) Edition, but we support Bedrock (Console, Mobile) Edition players too. This means everyone can play together!\n\n## üë§ Who is this for?\nPlayers looking to...\n- Own **entire world** instead of small plots grouped with others.\n    - Customize their **world settings**.\n- Use time-saving building tools such as **WorldEdit, Voxel Sniper, goBrush, and goPaint**.\n- Work with a community of **friendly** people to **learn and build with**.\n- Share your builds, host and participate in events, and have **fun**.\n\n\n## üìú What makes us different?\n### Freedom\n- The server runs on **open soure software**, some custom-developed by the owner, Martin.\n- Players have extensive control over their plots.\n- Players are able to export their creations into schematics they can download. This gives them the freedom to take their creations anywhere.\n\n### Expertise\n- We provide **useful, high quality documentation** for creative tools that can be used on the server like WorldEdit.\n\n### Community\n- We're focused on listening to feedback and keeping our small community happy.\n\n# ü™ê Planet System\nCommunity members can own in-game areas called planets.\nPlanet owners can use their planet to create mini-games, homes, or anything else that respects our Community Guidelines.\nFriends can be trusted for group projects.\n\n\n# üéØ What is our goal?\nWe're aiming to have the planet system feel like a mini server where each planet has a unique experience to offer and controls to match it.\n\n\n# üîì No Lock-In\nPlanet owners can export their creations to a downloadable schematic. This gives players the freedom to bring their creations anywhere.
